            <p>I am a student on the AI conversion focused Connected Environments MSc at UCL. The course is based on the east London campus. I am learning how to code from scratch. It's exciting although a steep learning curve. I have a background in journalism and hope this AI conversion course will lead to an exciting new adventure and help me find a space of belonging at the intersection of conflict resolution, environment, tech and storytelling.</p>
            
            <p>I am a mature student who is looking to upskill my career. I studied English Language and Literature at Oxford University before then embarking on a 20 year international journalism career. So while I have plenty of experience in storytelling, this chapter of my life and career is a whole new ballgame. I am neurodivergent and come from a humanities background. I'm not afraid of a challenge but I certainly think academic life will be certainly different to what I'm used to.</p>
            
            <p>I am a writer and I also have a podcast which I created from scratch. I have written a book bringing together nature, animals and financial literacy and most of my journalism has focused on human-centred storytelling. The course is supposed to be very nuts-and-bolts orientated so I am certainly out of my comfort zone but operating in this interdisciplinary field is certainly a privilege. Do come along on the journey with me. Let's think of it as another magical mystery tour. Other things that might be of interest include the fact I like improv; doodling; anything related to weird and wonderful animals; trying to understand and decode human behaviour and also figure out solutions so that our world feels a lot more connected.
