            <h3>What is is Connected Environments?</h3>

            <p>Quoting directly from the Connected Environments own homepage:</p>
            <blockquote cite="https://connected-environments.org/"><i>
                "Our new MSc programme developed with industry builds on the need for a set of skills in programming, data capture, visualization, and prototyping with stakeholders to support the analysis of complex systems. Our unique kinaesthetic approach means that our research and teaching are delivered within a living lab environment. We believe in learning through doing and have a focus on building and deploying physical prototypes to develop the transferable skill set which is employable in the emerging market place of the Internet of Things, Smart Cities, Future Living and Data Science."</i>
